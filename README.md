# Three-Lane-Traffic-Management-System-using-Tiva-C-Series-Microcontroller-
The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a fully automated traffic light system for a three-road intersection, utilizing Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) as the primary signalling mechanism. The focus is on developing an intelligent control algorithm that optimizes traffic flow, reduces congestion, and enhances overall road safety. Additionally, the incorporation of a seven-segment display will enable the clear visualization of the signal timer, contributing to enhanced communication and awareness amongst drivers.
